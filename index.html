<h2>📊 What is a Prediction Market?</h2>
<p>A prediction market is a financial platform where users buy or sell contracts based on the outcomes of real-world events. Each share's price represents the market's collective belief in that event's probability.</p>
<p><strong>Price = Probability:</strong> If a share trades at $0.75, the market estimates a 75% chance the event will occur. If the event happens, the share pays out $1; otherwise, $0.</p>

<h2>📈 Detailed Example Transactions</h2>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example 1: Kamala Harris wins 2024 US Election</h3>
<p>Market price: $0.48 (48% chance)<br>
You buy 200 “Yes” shares for $96.<br>
If she wins → Payout = $200 → <strong>Profit = $104</strong><br>
If she loses → Payout = $0 → <strong>Loss = $96</strong></p>
